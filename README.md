#E-LEARNING WEBSITE

INTRODUCTION
E-learning website is a free and user-friendly platform designed to help students and learners improve their skills in programming, web development,and data science.It offers a variety of 
courses all available at no cost.The site includes essential sections like Home,Contact,Services,About Us,Login,Logout,Feedback and Courses.Users must register and log in to access courses 
and submit feedback ensuring secure and personalized content. Website is developed using HTML,CSS,JavaScript,and PHP.Website provides an engaging experience with XAMPP serving as the local 
server for testing and managing data.Admins have full control over user accounts,course content,and platform maintenance.

Hardware Requirements:
E-learning website requires a system with basic but efficient hardware specifications.An Intel Core i5 processor is used to ensure smooth performance during development tasks.A minimum of
512 GB of hard disk storage is recommended to store project files, tools and databases comfortably.The system should have a standard output display for clear viewing of the interface and 
testing the website layout.A standard QWERTY keyboard is used for coding and interacting with the development environment, while a standard two-button mouse provides easy navigation and c
ontrol throughout the development process.

Software Requirements:
E-learning website involves the use of several essential software tools. XAMPP is used as the local web server to run and test the website during development. MySQL serves as the database
system for storing user information, course details, feedback and other related data. PHP is used as the backend scripting language to handle the website's logic, manage database 
interactions and ensure smooth server-side operations. For frontend development HTML is used to structure the web pages while CSS is applied to design and style the user interface, 
creating an attractive and responsive layout for users.

DATABASE DESIGN
Database for this e-learning platform is designed to manage users,courses,enrollments, feedback and user sessions effectively.The Users table stores user details such as name,email, 
password and the timestamp of account creation.The Courses table contains information about each course including the course name,description,video URL and image URL.The Enrollments 
table connects users and courses which user has enrolled in which course along with the created_at attribute of enrollment.The Feedback table allows users to provide feedback on their 
learning experience,storing the user ID, feedback content, timestamp, and a rating.To track login activity, the User_sessions table records each users login time and date.Each table uses 
an Id column as the primary key and foreign keys like user_id and course_id are used to maintain relationships between users and courses.


Objectives
The main objective of the E-learning website is to provide free,quality education such as programming,web development and data science.The platform is designed to be user-friendly 
and responsive,allowing users to easily register,log in,access course and submit feedback.By using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP the website ensures a smooth and interactive learning
experience.Access to course content and feedback features is securely restricted to registered users,protecting and offering a personalized experience.Admins have full control to manage 
users,update course content,see platform activity.The website also enable users to learn from anywhere.Overall, the project aims to promote skill development and empower users with both 
academic and practical knowledge for personal and professional growth.

CONCLUSION
E-learning website is a modern, flexible and completely free platform designed for students and anyone eager to gain new skills.It offers user registration, login/logout, course access, 
and feedback submission ensuring only registered users can access learning materials.Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP and also using XAMPP.Site provides a secure and user-friendly
experience.Admins manage users and content to keep the platform running smoothly.Project successfully delivers accessible and free education allowing users to learn at their own pace and 
improve knowledge.
